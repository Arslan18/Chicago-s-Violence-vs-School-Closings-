# Intro

Do school closings have an impact on Chicago’s violence? In recent years Chicago has seen a spike in homicide rates across the city, but mostly in the South and West sides. The purpose of this research is to see if there is an impact on violence due to the closings of public schools. We will use newspaper articles and other sources to obtain our information, and analyze data through r programming to see the correlation between the two. Although many factors contribute to the violence in Chicago, it will be unique to look at school closings and to find a correlation. A lot of research has been done with regards to the violence in Chicago, but rarely are school closings mentioned in the same topic. In this paper you’ll learn about the violence in Chicago, and where it occurs. Then, we will discuss school closings and where most of those occurred across the city. After that, we will use data given by the city of Chicago and other sources to see a correlation amongst the two and see if they are related.  
What separates Chicago from other major cities is segregation. The North side of the city is where majority of the white population is compared to the South and West sides. Not only that, but the North side has a higher average income as well. The South and West sides of the city is where majority of the minorities reside in. It has a predominately African American and Hispanic population, with lower income neighborhoods compared to the North side of the city. After learning this information, where do you think majority of the violence occurs in the city? If your answer is the South and West sides, then you are correct. Here is a heat graph showing a map of the city of Chicago and where the violence mostly occurs. The dataset that was used in order to create this graph was given by the city of Chicago. It has information regarding the homicides that occurred from 2001-to present, location, and time. 
 


```{r The Greatest City Ever}
Chicago = read_csv("Homicides (2).csv")
Chicago$Location[Chicago$Location == ''] <- NA
Chicago = na.omit(Chicago)
Chicago1= Chicago %>% extract(Location, c('Latitude', 'Longitude'), '\\(([^,]+), ([^)]+)\\)')
Chicago$Longitude = round(as.numeric(Chicago$Longitude), 2)
Chicago$Latitude <- round(as.numeric(Chicago$Latitude), 2)
locationCrimes <- as.data.frame(table(Chicago$Longitude, Chicago$Latitude))
names(locationCrimes) <- c('long', 'lat', 'Frequency')
locationCrimes$long <- as.numeric(as.character(locationCrimes$long))
locationCrimes$lat <- as.numeric(as.character(locationCrimes$lat))
locationCrimes <- subset(locationCrimes, Frequency > 0)
map<-get_map(location='chicago', zoom = 11,maptype='roadmap',source="google")
ggmap(map) + geom_tile(data = locationCrimes, aes(x = long, y = lat, alpha = Frequency),
                           fill = 'red') + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank())
#The dataset that was used in order to create this graph was given by the city of Chicago. It has information regarding the homicides that occurred from 2001-to present, location, and time. 
```

# Chicago's Violence 

The total number of homicides that have occurred in Chicago since 2001 is around 9,060 (City of Chicago, 2018). After placing the locations of these homicides on the heat chart you can see how most of the homicides occur in the South and West side of the city. The darker shades of red indicate higher homicides in that given location compared to the lighter shades. The x-axis in this heat graph is longitude and the y-axis is latitude which helped us to find the locations of the homicides in the city. The frequency measures the prevalence of homicides in the area. Applying these things together with the data given from the city helped create this map to show us where these homicides are mostly occurring across the city, and by creating this heat map gives us a visual representation on the homicides. Another thing that separates Chicago from other major cities is how the homicide rates in the city of Chicago aren’t going down. Other cities like New York, LA, Huston, etc. have shown signs of progression except Chicago. Just recently in 2012 Chicago was given the title as “The Murder Capital of America” (Ward Room Staff, 2012). Since then Chicago has always been the top 5 city with the highest homicide rates, and hasn’t shown much signs of improvement.


```{r Hours of violence}
chicago_homicide <- read.csv("Homicides (2).csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
chicago_homicide$Date <- strptime(chicago_homicide$Date, format = '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
chicago_homicide$Day <- weekdays(chicago_homicide$Date)
chicago_homicide$Hour <- chicago_homicide$Date$hour
dailyCrimes <- as.data.frame(table(chicago_homicide$Day, chicago_homicide$Hour))
names(dailyCrimes) <- c('Day', 'Hour', 'Freq')
dailyCrimes$Hour <- as.numeric(as.character(dailyCrimes$Hour))
dailyCrimes$Day <- factor(dailyCrimes$Day, ordered = TRUE, 
                          levels = c('Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'))
ggplot(dailyCrimes, aes(x = Hour, y = Freq)) + geom_line(aes(group = Day, color = Day)) + xlab('Hour') + ylab('Number of homicides') + ggtitle('Timing of the Homicides')
# Same dataset was used in this graph as the previous, but instead of specifying the location this time  emphasized on time and day of the homicides. 
```

#When Do These Homicides Occur? 
In this line graph you can see what time the homicides are occurring across the city. The colors indicate the different days of the week and in the x-axis the time is measured in military timing. From this information given in the dataset by the city, we can see that most homicides occur late nights on weekends and mostly around evenings on week days. The least timing for homicides to occur are early mornings or during school hours. After realizing this information, it made me think even more how schools might have an impact on the homicide rates around these times. Another reason why homicides were more likely to occur at night during weekends is because school are off as well. Does this prove that violence and schools are related to one another in the city of Chicago?


#CPS School Closings
In addition to the homicide rates in Chicago, we looked into more information on students being affected by CPS school closings. It is estimated that about 54 Chicago Public Schools (CPS) have been terminated by the CPS board of education. After learning this information, we wanted to learn more about where these schools were being terminated in the city. As a result, we created our own csv file with information regarding the locations of the schools that were terminated and their neighborhood. This was necessary in order to take the next step, which was to see where most of these school closing are happening. With the help of the university of Chicago, we were provided with the listing of the schools closed and the schools that the students were transferred to in their research report.


```{r School Closings}
#Saving the data to Schools_closed
Schools_closed <- read_csv("School Closings  (1).csv")
#Creating a Geom_bar with ggplot
##This bar graph shows the number of school closing in a specific location in Chicago.
##Figure(1)
Schools_closed %>% ggplot(aes(x=Location1, color=Location1))+geom_bar(aes(fill=Location1))
```
---
As you can see in the bar graph we have created, it seems as though the majority of the school closings are located in the south and west side part of chicago. We were also curious as to where these students are transferring to, and the University of Chicago also provided this information for us defining them as welcoming schools.
```{r Schools}
#This graph shows the number of welcming schools in a specific location in Chicago
##Figure(2)
Schools_closed %>% ggplot(aes(x=Location2, color=Location2))+geom_bar(aes(fill=Location2))
```

---

#Why are they closing?

Based on the information we found regarding the school closings, we can see that these students are transferring to nearby schools. The schools that closed in the south side went to other schools in the south side, and etc. Through some extensive research we learned that most of these schools closed due to poor academic performances, schools were understaffed, and some schools were underutilized. Due to these reasons given by the city itself believed that closing these schools will increase their budget for funding other school to improve and do better.  
 

#Who is affected?

```{r Misconducts}
misconducts_cps <- read_csv("Misconduct_Report_EOY2017_Citywide (1).csv")
misconducts_cps %>%ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=`# of Misconducts2`, color=Category))+geom_point()
```
---

After analyzing our data with regards to the number of misconducts committed by CPS students through a geom-point graph, what we found was very interesting. In the graph you can see how majority of males have the highest number of misconducts, specifically the African American male students. Marisa De La Torre has done a research report on this and published it at the University of Chicago CCSR in the year 2015, which showed who was affected mostly by these school closings. In her report, she informed us how most of the school closings impacted 88% of the African American youth that attended these schools (DeLaTorre, 2015). This strengthens our evidence from the plot graph showing African Americans with the most misconducts. Knowing that their schools were at the point of termination it looks like they had the most number of misconducts during the year 2012-2013. This makes sense because during that year is when the CPS board of education decided to close down 54 schools for the upcoming year. What we can deduct from this is that these students knew that there would be no repercussions for their actions because they would not be attending the school. As a result, they found it reasonable to break the school’s code of conduct. This might indicate why the number of misconducts were higher than any other school year. Also, it shows how school closings might have a negative effect towards these students. It might even have a reason for such a high homicide rate that year too. Even an article published by the Huffington post stated how in the year 2012 young students were impacted by the gun violence the most (HuffingtonPost,2012). Can this show the correlation?


#Correlation?

As we can see from the bar graph and the mapping of the violence, majority of the violence and homicides are occurring in the areas where the schools have been shut down. Which is the south and west sides of the city. After intensive research regarding these neighborhoods we had to see if school closing impacted the homicide rates, and what we found was interesting. After the school closed in 2013, the city saw a drop in the homicide rates but that can be said for a number of reasons. One of the biggest being, since Chicago faced such high homicide rates in 2012 this statistic can be very relative. Not only that according to an article published by Chicago Homicide watch noticed a decrease in homicides, but an increase in the overall number of shootings that happened across the city. It goes to show how statistics can be misleading and the numbers might not actually say what they mean. 

#Conclusion 
A lot of things factor into violence and deaths across the city. One thing that can have a impact on the homicide rates in Chicago is school closings. It is very difficult to find a direct correlation with the two, but after conducting this research it is clear that the two are somewhat related. School closings increase the likelihood of homicides and violence across the city. By closing Public Schools, we are putting the students at risk who have to commute to a different school and come across the violence during their travels. In addition, the students are more likely to also be situated with that violence rather than going to school. Another thing we can correlate is the year of the school closings with the year of the number of misconducts by the student. We can see that in the same year the schools were closed, which was the year 2013, is the same year where the students had the highest number of misconducts. This correlation tells us that students are more likely to engage activity that violates the code of conduct. In conclusion, not only does school closing contribute to the violence in Chicago, but also has an effect on student’s behaviors inside the classroom.
